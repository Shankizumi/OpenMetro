Project Overview:
Project By-Shashank Gupta
Project Name: WeatherPage
Purpose: This React-based web application fetches and displays current weather conditions for a user-specified city, including temperature, UV index, visibility, and weather descriptions.
Features:
*Fetches geolocation data for a city.
*Retrieves hourly weather forecasts using Open-Meteo's API.
*Dynamically updates the body background image based on the current weather condition.
*Displays weather alerts if available.

Technologies Used:

*React: Main framework for building the UI components.
*CSS: Custom styles for a polished and user-friendly interface.
*APIs:
    -Open-Meteo Geocoding API: Fetches latitude and longitude based on the city name.
    -Open-Meteo Weather API: Retrieves hourly weather data.
*JavaScript: Used for data fetching and handling API responses.
*React Router: Handles query parameters (e.g., city name).

Key Components:

*WeatherPage.jsx:
    -Main component that handles data fetching and UI rendering.
    -Contains hooks (useEffect, useState) for side effects and state management.
    -Updates the body background image based on weather conditions to visually reflect the weather.
*WeatherPage.css:
    -Custom styles for the container and text to ensure readability against various background images.

Important Code Sections:

*Weather Descriptions and Images:
    -A weatherDescriptions object maps weather codes to human-readable descriptions.
    -A weatherImages object maps weather codes to specific background images for visual consistency.
*Background Styling:
    -The useEffect hook updates the body background image, size, and position dynamically.
*Error Handling:
    -Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages if the city is not found or an API call fails.

Project Setup:

*Install Dependencies:
    -Ensure react-router-dom is installed for handling URL parameters:
     bash
     Copy code
     npm install react-router-dom

*Folder Structure:
     src/components/WeatherPage.jsx: Main component file.
     src/components/WeatherPage.css: Styles for the component.
     public/images/: Directory for weather condition background images.

API Key:
*The Open-Meteo API used here does not require an API key. If integrating other services, ensure proper API key handling.

Future Aspects:
Additional Data: Integrate data such as wind speed, humidity, or multi-day forecasts.
User Customization: Allow users to select different themes.
Animations: Add subtle animations to text for enhanced visuals.
Localization: Support multiple languages for weather descriptions.
Enhance UI: Change background image with weather condition.
PWA: Convert the project into a Progressive Web App (PWA) for offline use and mobile optimization.
